## Assignment     
## Brief  
I have been tasked with creating a website which meets the following client requirements:  
### **A profile of the company itself**  
I have included this on the home page of the website, it included an introduction of the company, what the company does, how the company can help you or your business and what the company is good at/ does best.  
Also on the home Page I have included a company logo which i created myself using https://www.logomaker.com/, aswell as a bright blue background to make the website look less 'boring'. 

### **Profiles of existing trainee web developers**  
I have added 3 company trainee web developers 
i found images on unsplash.com where i could find high quality images for free without breaking copyright laws, the links for all are:   

**John Smith**- (@christianbuehner) SONY, ILCE-7RM3, the link for this photo is https://unsplash.com/photos/mens-blue-and-white-button-up-collared-top-DItYlc26zVI  
I also wrote a description for him, posing as a trainee web developer, i wrote: "John is a skilled developer who specializes in HTML, Python and JavaScript. His passion is creating websites and videogames, he has a passion for helping others and is one of our most promising employees." I tried to make this profile as realsitic as possible for the user.

**Jason Martin**- Canon, EOS 6D, the link for this photo is https://unsplash.com/photos/man-sitting-near-gray-steel-roller-shutters-during-daytime-Nm70URdtf3c  
I also wrote a description for him, posing as a trainee web developer, i wrote: "Jason is one of our newer web developers, originally specializing with only Python, Jason has recently learnt Node.js and HTML. He came here with little knowledge and now is extremely skilled in lots of different areas." 

**Matthew Pooley**- Canon, EOS 5D Mark III, the link for this photois https://unsplash.com/photos/man-wearing-maroon-v-neck-t-shirt-in-forest-agGIKYs4mYs  
I also wrote a description for him, posing as a trainee web developer, i wrote: "Matthew specializes in web development, often helping create websites for small businesses and for personal use. He also can code in HTML, CSharp, Python and JavaScript. He now has lots of knowledge and has a very promising career ahead of him."

All of these photos were used for my trainee web developers to help create a profile for them, and the decriptions were made to match this.

### **Job specifications and required qualifications**  
 I have included all qualifications that are expected to apply for this role, i have also included additional specifications that are required for this role, these include:  
 - Have a full UK driving licence  
- Have at least 5 grade 4s or above at GCSE level, including English Language and Mathematics  
- Have experience in web development and a basic understanding  
- x3 Merit grades or above at A Level in any subject (ideally IT based)  
Also, I included how to apply for this course where I wrote "To apply for Hot Bean Web, you need to have completed training courses or qualifications related to web development, and looking for a job as a web developer." I also included a link at the bottom of the page which takes you directly to the application form.  


### **An on-line application form**  
I have designed an application form that can be completed on the website, it includes:  
- First and Last Name  
- Your Email  
- Your Mobile Number  
- If you have a valid driving License  
- Why are you suited for this role?  
I have designed this to make it as simple as possible whilst containing all of the relevant information required to apply for a position at Hot Bean Web.

### **Links to web development courses**  
I have included links to different web development courses these include:  
- **FreeCodeCamp**- For this link I included a description of the website, I wrote "Free Code Camp is a free coding website with over 11,500 tutorials for coding, on this website you can learn anything with coding in lots of different languages." I did this to show the user what this link to the website is about to help them decide if it is relevant to them. 

- **Code Academy**- For this link I included a description of the website I wrote "Code Academy is a coding website with lots of different languages including Python, C++, Java and many more, it also contains a paid section for students to help further expand their understanding." I did this to show the user wha the link to the website is about to help them decide if it is relevant to them.  

- **IT Online Learning**- For this link I included a description of the website, I wrote "IT Online Learning is a coding website with many different features including courses, successful stories and career programs, they also have information about the programs including average salary and expectations." I did this to show the user wha the link to the website is about to help them decide if it is relevant to them.  

These links have been added to help the user find a Job or a course related to IT and coding with all of the links taking them to different companies that will help them to acheive this. In addition to this, these websites also help the user to learn new information to prepare them for a job or course.

## **Review**
I reviewed my website with others to help suggest any potential improvements that may be necessary.  

### **Adam Martin:**  
Based on what I have seen, I beleive that this website is very good and doesnt need much improvement, however, there is a few things I would change:  
- I would add more images to the website to make it more interesting rather than just have lots of writing.  
- When you submit the application form, a little message would be nice to show that the information has been received rather than it taking you straight back to the home page.  

### **Jacob Pooley:**  
I like this website and I think it meets all of the requirements, but there is a few things I dont like:  
- I dont like the how there are different colours being used for the background depending what page you are on and I beleive it should all be the same colour throughout.  
- I also dont like how some of the pages look squished and I think you should use more of the page to make the alyout look more professional.  

### **My Response:**  
Based on this feedback, I agree with most of the points being made therefore I will consider these changes in the future if I was to redesign, edit or make a new website.  

### **Additional Information:**  

I have tested the website fully and it functions as expected with all of the features doing there intended task.  

Also, I added easy navigation with a container in the top left hand corner which the user can click to easily direct them to any part of the website, this feature is on all parts of the website so the user can easily navigate to wherever they need to be.
